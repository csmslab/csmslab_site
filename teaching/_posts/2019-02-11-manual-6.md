Left click **CIW:Open -> Quit**

A dialog box should appear, and asks to confirm the request. Left click OK to exit Cadence, or left click **Cancel** to resume. If you have any unsaved work, the save cell view form appears with the library, cell and cell view names. Left click on **OK** after making all the appropriate choices. All Cadence windows will now close, and the design session will end.
